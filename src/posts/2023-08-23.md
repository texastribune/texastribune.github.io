## What was your path to the Tribune? Why did you want to apply?

During my junior year of college, I was eager to gain real-world experience, prompting me to apply to the Emma Bowen Foundation. This path eventually led me to an interview with Ashley at The Texas Tribune, where the prospect of becoming a fellow emerged. Initially, I held concerns about how seamlessly my skills could integrate into the realm of journalism. However, during the interview, my perspective shifted as I began to comprehend the synergy between technology and journalism.

My childhood aspirations consistently revolved around developing solutions that could enhance the quality of life for others. While journalism wasn't my initial career inclination, I gradually recognized the pivotal role of technology in this field. This realization intensified my desire to explore various applications in which technology wields its influence.

Equally captivating was Ashley's depiction of The Tribune's work environment. My aspiration was to join an organization where I could serve as an integral team member rather than just adhering to a conventional 9-to-5 routine. The Tribune offered an ideal setting that facilitated interactions extending beyond work-related discussions.

Intrigued by the symbiotic relationship between technology and journalism and motivated by the prospect of contributing to a vibrant community, I discovered in The Texas Tribune a pathway where I could wholeheartedly invest my efforts.

## What did you do during your fellowship? What have you learned?

Throughout my fellowship, I've engaged with a diverse spectrum of projects, spanning tasks such as refining the front-end of The Tribune to tackling server issues within the admin portal.

Among these endeavors, the first project that truly put my abilities to the test was addressing the challenge of recovering deleted articles. This task demanded a comprehensive approach, encompassing both front-end and back-end solutions. This experience provided me with a significant opportunity for growth and learning.

Another notable project I participated in involved assisting Suraj in the realm of machine learning. Given that we were in the experimental stages of machine larning implementation, our objective was to explore the statistical comparison of utilizing The Tribune's code to extract entities against a third-party program. As anticipated, the initial results aligned with our expectations. This prompted us to pivot towards a more advanced approached, wherein we aimed to provide the machine with the contextual framework of the sentence containing entities. 

## What was the most surprising part of the fellowship?

The fellowship unveiled a surprising array of diverse tasks, presenting a remarkable opportunity for me as I strive to become a full-stack engineer. The ability to readily seek assistance from the team throughout my fellowship has enhanced my engineering skills.

Furthermore, I had the opportunity to delve into the field of machine learning under the guidance of Suraj. Previously, I had doubted my experience and knowledge in this area, but with his help, I gained insights and explored the vast possibilities it holds.

This fellowship has exceeded my expectations by offering a variety of tasks, fostering a collaborative environment for seeking assistance, and creating pathways into the field of machine learning that I once considered beyond my skill set.

## What is your favorite memory from the fellowship?

One of my most cherished memories from this experience is the deep dive into machine learning. In a traditional academic setting, obtaining hands-on experience can be challenging, making this opportunity to learn and actively engage in the field truly unforgettable.

Furthermore, another cherished memory revolves around our bi-weekly stand-up meetings and knowledge-sharing sessions. Despite the remote setup, these interactions fostered a strong sense of camaraderie within the team. Observing fellow team members and gaining insights into their projects and approaches transformed our interactions from merely professional to something more profound than just a conventional work environment.

## What is your advice for anyone applying?

Confronting something new is invariably accompanised by a sense of intimidation, yet this sentiment underscores the depth of our determnation not to dissapoint others. During my time as a fellow at The Tribune, I encountered challenge and obstables that demanded attention. Acknowledging that these hurdles are essential for our growth will make us better than who we were in the past.

The Tribune stands as an ideal ground for gaining expereience across an array of projects. The team is dedicated to offering assistance, not solely for the work at hand, but also in shaping your future trajectory.
