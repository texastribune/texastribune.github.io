In February 2021, The Texas Tribune engineering team rolled out a feature that adds timestamps of the publish year on the images shared (og:images) along with our articles. In this post, we'll take a look at that process.

Many ideas for our products start with a simple Slack message.

In the Tweet, [@ylichterman](https://twitter.com/ylichterman) observed that The New York Times started adding date labels to their posts and the tweet also linked out to [this Guardian post on the subject](https://www.niemanlab.org/2019/04/the-guardians-nifty-old-article-trick-is-a-reminder-of-how-news-organizations-can-use-metadata-to-limit-misinformation/). The Guardian generously open sources their front-end, which allowed us to get some perspective on one technical implementation example.

This was the inspiration we needed to figure out if we had tools already in our stack to make this feature possible. That's where [Thumbor](https://github.com/thumbor/thumbor) comes in. We already served all of our images through Thumbor to enable us to crop photos and optimize file sizes, but that only scratches the surface of what Thumbor can do.

## Adding watermarks with Thumbor
We were always aware of [filters in Thumbor](https://thumbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/filters.html), but until now, we'd never found a good use case. The [watermark filter](https://thumbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/watermark.html) will overlay any image URL you specify and will place the watermark at the x,y coordinates of your choosing. This was exactly what we needed.

Our texastribune.org site runs on Django. In order to keep the filter syntax consistent and straightforward in our templates, we created a [template tag](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/howto/custom-template-tags/#writing-custom-template-tags) to dynamically build the Thumbor image URLs, based on whether the article was old enough needed a date overlay. That way we could just write something like this in our metadata templates:

```html
<meta property="og:image" content="{% raw %}{% og_image_url article %}{% endraw %}">
```

And back in our template tag, we build the URL by referencing the watermark image that we've opted to host in s3 for now:

```py
generate_url(image_url=article.meta_art_url, width=width, height=height, filters=watermark(cdn.texastribune.org/media/watermarks/2016.png,-0,30,0))
```

The `generate_url` syntax above is referencing the [django-thumbor](https://github.com/ricobl/django-thumbor) library.

## Designing the watermarks
Now that we had a method of programmatically creating the share images with date labels, we needed a streamlined way to generate the overlay graphics for each year. We worked with our talented Art team to come up with a branded concept for the watermark images.

</figure>

With a [CSS framework](https://texastribune.github.io/queso-ui/) that matches the styles of our brand already in place, it was then possible to stick to what we know (HTML/CSS) to implement the watermarks' design.

In our CSS framework docs site, which is built with 11ty, we use nunjucks templating to loop through our years of existence as an org and output the date labels with [plain ol' HTML/CSS](https://github.com/texastribune/queso-ui/blob/main/docs/src/date-labels.njk#L13-L24).

```html
  {% raw %}{% for year in years %}{% endraw %}

    <div class="has-b-btm-marg">
      <div class="date-label has-bg-black has-text-white t-weight-bold t-serif t-lh-s">
        <div class="l-align-center-children">
          <div class="c-icon has-text-yellow"><svg aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#bug"></use></svg></div>
          <div class="has-tiny-btm-marg">
            <span class="t-size-l"><em>from</em></span> <span class="t-size-xxxl">{% raw %}{{ year }}{% endraw %}</span>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

  {% raw %}{% endfor %}{% endraw %}
```




This creates individual labels that [we can then screenshot](https://github.com/texastribune/queso-ui/blob/main/docs/config/tasks/date-labels.js) and export to an s3 bucket.

## Date labels in the wild

Shortly after launching this feature, Texas was under a national spotlight for [issues with our state-run electrical grid](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/02/15/rolling-blackouts-texas/). That meant we were suddenly getting a good deal of traffic and social reach for this [2011 explainer on why Texas has its own power grid](https://www.texastribune.org/2011/02/08/texplainer-why-does-texas-have-its-own-power-grid/).

<video controls width="400" loop muted>

  <source src="{{ '/images/posts/date-labels-video.mp4' | url }}"type="video/mp4">
  Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.

People were sharing that article on Twitter and fortunately the date labels were working as expected. That meant we were being transparent about when that article was published and as a bonus established ourselves being historically knowledgeable on the topic.
